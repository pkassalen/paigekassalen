## Creation of a user research protocol and completion of three interviews

Research Protocol:

a. The target audience for my story:
      My target audience is people looking to create their own start-up in the 20-30 year old age range or people who are interested in       learning more about how certain things affect who has the opportunity to become an innovator. The reason this is my audience is         because there is a lot of data out there about how to build a successful business, but it would be helpful to have transparency         around who has the opportunities to become an innovator and have a roadmap to be successful against the odds. 
      
b. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:

   1 - I want to interview someone who has started their own company to get their perspective on other factors I might not be thinking      about when it comes to "who becomes the innovator." 
   
   2 - I want to interview someone who is fresh out of college and potentially thinking about starting their own company to learn  what    information this person might think is interesting.

   3 - I want to interview someone who identifies as a minority to see what their thoughts are in diversity in entrepreneurship.
      
c. Interview script: 

   "Hello! I am working on a project focused on effectively communicating the message of a dataset focused around the question "who         becomes the innovator. My goal is to outline the current state of entrepreneurship in the country, break down the current state         by different demographics (race, gender, etc.), analyze 4-5 factors that influence who is granted a patent, generate the high-           level trends from the data, and then propose recommendations if you are looking to start a business. 
      
      Q1: What is your first high-level takeaway from the story board?
      Q2: How long does it take you to understand the story?
      Q3: What parts are confusing?
      Q4: What would you like to see more of? Less of?
      Q5: What do you think is missing?
      Q6: Is this story interesting? Why or why not? 
      Q7: After reviewing this, what does the story make you want to do?
      
   Thank you for your help!"

d. The findings from my interview:

   Interview 1:
   
     Q1: What is your first high-level takeaway from the story board?
	The subsection of people that can be entrepreneurs and get patents is smaller than I thought. I was surprised most of the VC spending went to 3 states and that only ¼ of small business owners are women. 

     Q2: How long does it take you to understand the story?
	I understood the flow, but I’m not sure if I understand the graphs. 

     Q3: What parts are confusing?
	There are just some typos and some poorly worded sentences. Diverse people can solve diverse issues. Add another sentence related to small businesses not solving the right problems. Non-diverse groups solve non-diverse problems. 

	Not consistent wording also.

     Q4: What would you like to see more of? Less of?
	More: I like the diversity thing and the focus on diverse groups and diverse issues. I think you should focus on having people understand how to not fail when having a small business. 

	I like the map but make sure the key is readable. If you have good graphs that showcase the data, I think it would be interesting. 

	Less: The story is not that big, so I think everything is fine. 

     Q5: What do you think is missing?
	Explain what the recommendations are. I think you need to get to the root cause of what the problem is for why diverse small businesses fail. I think you should focus on lack of diversity leading to lack of ability to solve diverse problems, so how do we fix this? 

	Focus on how to help people not fail at starting a business. 

     Q6: Is this story interesting? Why or why not? 
	I think it is interesting because I do think a lot of people want to be their own boss so if someone sees this and wants to start their own business they will have some takeaways from this. 

     Q7: After reviewing this, what does the story make you want to do?
	I want to expand my view of the next business I want to start to make sure I’m asking the next question and solving an actual problem. It makes me want to do more research about what I can do to get more opportunities as a women leader of a small businesses. 



   Interview 2:
   
      Q1: What is your first high-level takeaway from the story board?
            People want to be their own boss
      
      Q2: How long does it take you to understand the story?
            I could understand the story quickly. You are trying to tell the story that people say entrepreneurship is good and there should be diversity, but due to a bunch of data, becoming an entrepreneur isn't as diverse as it should be. 
      
      Q3: What parts are confusing?
	I was confused by the graphs and the different statistics because we went from entrepreneurship to patents. Maybe a transition explaining why patents are related is important. 
      
      Q4: What would you like to see more of? Less of?
	More: Explanation of what the graphs mean and why they matter
	Less: Graphs without explanation
      
      Q5: What do you think is missing?
	How much money different groups of people get from the VCs. Also I think your graph sketches were not informative enough to help me understand your story.
      
      Q6: Is this story interesting? Why or why not? 
	Yes, entrepreneurship is a popular career move now a days so it’s cool to see what factors affect someone’s success
      
      Q7: After reviewing this, what does the story make you want to do?
	I don’t think I want to really do anything, but I think it’s important for me to keep in the back of my mind. 
	
   Interview 3:

	  Q1: What is your first high-level takeaway from the story board?
		 Focus on the importance of diversity in businesses and a lot of data about demographics of entrepreneurs 

	  Q2: How long does it take you to understand the story?
		 I think for the graphs it took me long because there was not a lot of information. I think with final graphs that are color coordinated, it will be helpful to fully understand the story. 

	  Q3: What parts are confusing?
		 I think you don’t have much transition from section to section. Like how can you seamlessly move from the what to the why to the data to the recommendations and make it feel like a story. 

	  Q4: What would you like to see more of? Less of?
		More: Breakdown by each demographic so people can be connected to the story no matter who they are. 

		Less: Stating facts without explanation. 

	  Q5: What do you think is missing?
		 I think you should have more substance in the recommendation slide because that will tie everything together and leave the reader remembering why the story matters. 	 

	  Q6: Is this story interesting? Why or why not? 
		I think so. I think if I were interested in starting a business as a minority, it is important to see the facts that I’m up against for things out of my control. 

	  Q7: After reviewing this, what does the story make you want to do?
		I think I want to explore what unmet needs I can solve that are distinct to the group I identify with. Maybe it would be cool for you to include some information about success stories of minority entrepreneurs. 


e. Changes I want to implemented in my sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified: 

   1. I want to take care of is creating transitions. This will help people explain the relevance of patents like Interviewee #2               mentioned. 
   
   2. I want to find some case study information about the success of minority business owners to support the data. I had been thinking       that I could only use charts to visualize data, but I should explore case studies as well. 
   
   3. I think having more high-level paragraphs to explain the data will clear up confusion, along with graphs that reflect the data and       are color coded will help. 

   4. I want to focus more on other reasons businesses don’t succeed instead of just who becomes an entrepreneur for the                       recommendations. 
   
## Revised wireframes / visualizations / storyboards based on what you heard

A working draft of my shorthand final presentation can be found here: https://preview.shorthand.com/JdSAOb13Vkhzg6Ug

I still have a bit of work to complete, but I made adjustments to the 4 points I listed above. I have a transitions for explaining patents clearly, I have one case study, I have some high-level intro paragraphs, and then I have a chart (a little too small right now on my shorthand) that highlights the top reasons small businesses fail. 

	
## Mood Board

I want bright colors that will allow the data to pop because innovation is a fun subject.

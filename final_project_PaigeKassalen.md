# Outline

## High-level summary of my project:

Today, it seems like everyone is looking to launch a start-up. In 2018, there were 30.2 million small businesses operating in the U.S. One major question that arises when you look at innovation is the diversity of founders and inventors. 

My dataset outlines different factors like gender, family income, and location for the people granted patents. I am looking to uncover what factors influence who has the opportunity to be an inventor in 2019 America and then put together a roadmap to help people from non-traditional backgrounds to feel empowered to start a company, if they would like to. 

## Project structure that outlines the major elements of your story:

- Start with a chart about the state of innovation - This will showcase the relevance of the topic and allow people initially just process visual information instead of giving an introduction myself
- Move into a chart that highlights the diversity in the current state of innovation
- Both of these charts will express the "why" aspect of my analysis and set me up for moving into the focus question: "What factors influence who becomes in inventor in 2019 America?"
- I will then break down 4-5 criteria that relates to becoming an innovator from my data
- Then, I will readdress the question "why does this matter" but providing some statistics about how diversity in innovation is important
- I will end on "what can we do?" and create a roadmap for innovation

# Initial sketches

Here are a few examples of how I will convey the data:

# The Data

My data is "Who Becomes an Inventor in America? The Importance of Exposure to Innovation" and can be found at this link - http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/

I will also be pulling information to support the story line from sites like this: https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/03/startup-statistics-small-business.html, https://facesoffounders.org/the-state-of-inclusive-entrepreneurship-by-the-numbers-be422b8845ed, https://www.statista.com/statistics/693431/rate-of-new-entrepreneurs-by-race-us/ and https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics

This data set provides data to compare patents granted vs. different factors like city, state, number of kids in the city, gender, family income. Over 100 million start-ups are launched annually, but this dataset will allow me to explore if there are trends in relation to who has the opportunity to create a start-up and become an innovator. I want to break down the patents awarded compared to 4-5 different factors to see which are most influential in getting a patent. The overal goal of my story will be to develop a plan of action to help a diverse range of people become innovators. 

# Method and Medium

In my previous job, I led a project to create a virtual reality experience so I considered trying something different like VR or AR for my final project. The one challenge is that I don't think it is the best way to visualize my story, but I am still doing some research on options like this. 

I will most likely use Shorthand because I have not used it before and I think it would be good to learn. I want to include a lot of visualizations rather than words on my Shorthand project because I am going to see if the data can convey the message rather than support the words. 

I do want to see if there is a way to make my final project interactive and allow the viewers to craft their own story, but still get to the same conclusion.

## Creation of a user research protocol and completion of three interviews

Research Protocol:

a. The target audience for my story:
      My target audience is people looking to create their own start-up in the 20-30 year old age range or people who are interested in       learning more about how certain things affect who has the opportunity to become an innovator. The reason this is my audience is         because there is a lot of data out there about how to build a successful business, but it would be helpful to have transparency         around who has the opportunities to become an innovator and have a roadmap to be successful against the odds. 
      
b. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:
      1 - I want to interview someone who has started their own company to get their perspective on other factors I might not be               thinking about when it comes to "who becomes the innovator." 
      
      2 - I want to interview someone who is fresh out of college and potentially thinking about starting their own company to learn           what information this person might think is interesting.
      
      3 - I want to interview someone who identifies as a minority to see what their thoughts are in diversity in entrepreneurship.
      
c. Interview script
      "Hello! I am working on a project focused on effectively communicating the message of a dataset focused around the question "who          becomes the innovator. My goal is to outline the current state of entrepreneurship in the country, break down the current state          by different demographics (race, gender, etc.), analyze 4-5 factors that influence who is granted a patent, generate the high-          level trends from the data, and then propose recommendations if you are looking to start a business. 
      
      Q1: What is your first high-level takeaway from the story board?
      Q2: How long does it take you to understand the story?
      Q3: What parts are confusing?
      Q4: What would you like to see more of? Less of?
      Q5: What do you think is missing?
      Q6: Is this story interesting? Why or why not? 
      Q7: After reviewing this, what does the story make you want to do?
      
      Thank you for your help!"

d. The findings from my interview:
e. Changes I want to implemented in my sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified:

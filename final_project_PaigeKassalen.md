# Outline

## High-level summary of my project:

Today, it seems like everyone is looking to launch a start-up. In 2018, there were 30.2 million small businesses operating in the U.S. One major question that arises when you look at innovation is the diversity of founders and inventors. 

My dataset outlines different factors like gender, family income, and location for the people granted patents. I am looking to uncover what factors influence who has the opportunity to be an inventor in 2019 America and then put together a roadmap to help people from non-traditional backgrounds to feel empowered to start a company, if they would like to. 

## Project structure that outlines the major elements of your story:

- Start with a chart about the state of innovation - This will showcase the relevance of the topic and allow people initially just process visual information instead of giving an introduction myself
- Move into a chart that highlights the diversity in the current state of innovation
- Both of these charts will express the "why" aspect of my analysis and set me up for moving into the focus question: "What factors influence who becomes in inventor in 2019 America?"
- I will then break down 4-5 criteria that relates to becoming an innovator from my data
- Then, I will readdress the question "why does this matter" but providing some statistics about how diversity in innovation is important
- I will end on "what can we do?" and create a roadmap for innovation

# Initial sketches

Here are a few examples of how I will convey the data:

# The Data

My data is "Who Becomes an Inventor in America? The Importance of Exposure to Innovation" and can be found at this link - http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/

I will also be pulling information to support the story line from sites like this: https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/03/startup-statistics-small-business.html, https://facesoffounders.org/the-state-of-inclusive-entrepreneurship-by-the-numbers-be422b8845ed, https://www.statista.com/statistics/693431/rate-of-new-entrepreneurs-by-race-us/ and https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics

This data set provides data to compare patents granted vs. different factors like city, state, number of kids in the city, gender, family income. Over 100 million start-ups are launched annually, but this dataset will allow me to explore if there are trends in relation to who has the opportunity to create a start-up and become an innovator. I want to break down the patents awarded compared to 4-5 different factors to see which are most influential in getting a patent. The overal goal of my story will be to develop a plan of action to help a diverse range of people become innovators. 

# Method and Medium

In my previous job, I led a project to create a virtual reality experience so I considered trying something different like VR or AR for my final project. The one challenge is that I don't think it is the best way to visualize my story, but I am still doing some research on options like this. 

I will most likely use Shorthand because I have not used it before and I think it would be good to learn. I want to include a lot of visualizations rather than words on my Shorthand project because I am going to see if the data can convey the message rather than support the words. 

I do want to see if there is a way to make my final project interactive and allow the viewers to craft their own story, but still get to the same conclusion.

#The Data

My data is "Who Becomes an Inventor in America? The Importance of Exposure to Innovation" and can be found at this link - http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/

This data set provides data to compare patents granted vs. different factors like city, state, number of kids in the city, gender, family income. Over 100 million start-ups are launched annually, but this dataset will allow me to explore if there are trends in relation to who has the opportunity to create a start-up and become an innovator. I want to break down the patents awarded compared to 4-5 different factors to see which are most influential in getting a patent. The overal goal of my story will be to develop a plan of action to help a diverse range of people become innovators.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University and will be graduating in May 2020. Before beginning my masters, I worked as a market analyst for the future of mobility at a material science company called Covestro. In that role, I led a global project to develop a virtual reality sales and marketing tool for future vehicle materials and led stage-gate material development projects focused on autonomous vehicles, ridesharing and vehicle electrification. Prior to that role, I utilized my bachelors in electrical engineering, from Virginia Tech, on a global team working with a solar powered airplane that flew around the world.

For fun, I like to do a lot of DIY projects. I own a house in Mt. Washington where I installed my own flagstone patio, built my farmhouse table and chandelier, and remodeled my kitchen. I also have a love of scuba diving! I've been a diver for over 10 years and to celebrate my 10 year anniversary, I spent 3 days and two nights living on a dive boat out at the Great Barrier Reef.

## What I hope to learn in this class

Being able to influence stakeholders is very supportive. In my last role, I could never just say "this is a good idea." I needed to have solid evidence to back up my recommendations. This is a skill no one will ever perfect, so I am hoping to gain a deeper and well-rounded understanding of how to best communicate information in a way that is most influential to my audience.

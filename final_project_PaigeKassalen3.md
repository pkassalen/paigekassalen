# Final data story

## Intended Audience 

My intended audience is really anyone interested in starting a business or just anyone who is interested learning about equity in the space of entrepreneurship. So many people think the most important thing to do when starting a company is just getting the product to market, but there is a lot of data that shows you need to start building diversity and culture from day one because it is not just a "nice to have." 

To narrow my focus, I really just followed the data. I had data to position my story and help people understand the importance, but my data set about patent and grant childhood demographics was what I was most interested in exploring. After visualizing the data in different ways, I was able to focus my story on specific topics like "tech patents."

## Summary 

When I was reflecting on my data analysis experience, I was hoping that the data would help me build a roadmap for future entrepreneurs. It seems like income, gender, and education all have a large effect on if you receive a patent. These were not very surprising, so I had to figure out ways to break down the data in different ways.

One way was to look at gender by industry. This gave me a little more transparency to interesting trends. Another way was to break down education by class size and then percentage of students that received patents. 

I also wanted to incorporate something the virtual reality or augmented reality into my story and I feel like I should have started with that in mind and thought of a good dataset where that would work well. For this story, I don't think it would add much.

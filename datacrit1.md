Critique:

There are some things I believe this graphic does well and some that are not as helpful for the audience. The first thing is that the graphic is simple. You can quickly see the percentage of obesity of children in one of the 21 highlighted countries. The graphic does not use too many colors, making it less distracting to the reader. 

One major challenge of the graphic is the extra information included that is not explained to the reader. There are light blue markers that are not labeled. These light blue markers also have an ombre color pattern without explanation what they represent or what the colors represent. 

Another problem is that the graphic is not very memorable. After you look away, you cannot remember if Indonesia had greater obesity than Spain. Also, just by looking that graphic, it is hard to know if this matters in the grand scheme of the article. 

Wire Frams:

To attempt at improving the graphic, I created two different types of wire diagrams that assisted in solving the problems of the orginial graphic and then tested them with 2 people. 



Feedback:

Leah Kassalen – Sister

•	Can you tell me what you think this is? 
    Graph showing the % obesity of children broken down by country for graph 1 and graph showing % of obesity broken down by region and then country.

•	Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
    Obesity is a problem and these are the countries that are affected the most

•	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
    I like the idea of just having countries, but I think the color coding might be hard to keep straight. Based on the article, I think the broken down into region and then country is best.

•	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
    Normal people

•	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
    I would have more titles on the axis

•	Can you tell me what you think this is?
    This is a chart that explores the differences between countries and childhood obesity. 

•	Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
    There are some regions that obesity is very similar, but others where it ranges more. Also, obesity is a problem is specific countries. 

•	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
    More labeling of the axis

•	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
    People that are interested in health

•	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
    Try and keep things uniform and not too difficult for the reader to go back and forth with a legend.

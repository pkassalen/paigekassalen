•	Can you tell me what you think this is? 
    Graph showing the % obesity of children broken down by country for graph 1 and graph showing % of obesity broken down by region and then country.

•	Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
    Obesity is a problem and these are the countries that are affected the most

•	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
    I like the idea of just having countries, but I think the color coding might be hard to keep straight. Based on the article, I think the broken down into region and then country is best.

•	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
    Normal people

•	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
    I would have more titles on the axis

•	Can you tell me what you think this is?
    This is a chart that explores the differences between countries and childhood obesity. 

•	Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
    There are some regions that obesity is very similar, but others where it ranges more. Also, obesity is a problem is specific countries. 

•	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
    More labeling of the axis

•	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
    People that are interested in health

•	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
    Try and keep things uniform and not too difficult for the reader to go back and forth with a legend.
